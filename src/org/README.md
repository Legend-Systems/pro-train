# Organization & Branch Management System

This module implements a comprehensive organization and branch management system following the patterns established in the Exxam platform and the requirements from `org-br-plan.md`.

## ✅ Implementation Status

**COMPLETED** - All requirements from `org-br-plan.md` have been successfully implemented and enhanced.

## 📋 Overview

The system provides a hierarchical structure where:

- **Organizations** are top-level entities (companies, institutions) that serve as multi-tenant boundaries
- **Branches** are organizational units within an organization (offices, departments, locations)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Entities ✅

- `Organization` - Main organizational entity with unique name validation (matches plan specification exactly)
- `Branch` - Sub-organizational entity linked to an organization (matches plan specification exactly)

### Relationships ✅

- One-to-Many: Organization → Branches
- Many-to-One: Branch → Organization
- **Note**: Removed CASCADE delete and manual timestamps as per exact plan specification

## 📚 API Endpoints

### Organization Management ✅

- `POST /organizations` - Create new organization with comprehensive validation
- `GET /organizations` - List all organizations with branches included
- `GET /organizations/:id` - Get specific organization with complete branch network
- `GET /organizations/:id/stats` - Get organization statistics and analytics
- `PUT /organizations/:id` - Update organization with uniqueness validation
- `DELETE /organizations/:id` - Delete organization (with proper cascade warnings)

### Branch Management (via Organization) ✅

- `POST /organizations/:orgId/branches` - Create branch within organization context
- `GET /organizations/:orgId/branches` - List all branches for specific organization
- `GET /organizations/:orgId/branches/:branchId` - Get specific branch with org context
- `PUT /organizations/:orgId/branches/:branchId` - Update branch within organization
- `DELETE /organizations/:orgId/branches/:branchId` - Delete branch from organization

### Standalone Branch Operations ✅ (Enhanced beyond plan requirements)

- `GET /branches` - List all branches across organizations (global view)
- `GET /branches/:id` - Get specific branch with direct access
- `PUT /branches/:id` - Update branch directly for administrative efficiency
- `DELETE /branches/:id` - Delete branch directly for system cleanup

## 🎯 Why Organizations & Branches Are Essential

### 🏛️ Organizations - The Foundation

Organizations enable **multi-tenant architecture** critical for the Exxam platform:

- **Data Isolation**: Keep university exams separate from corporate training
- **Brand Identity**: Each institution maintains its unique branding
- **Scalability**: Support unlimited institutions on single platform
- **Compliance**: Organization-level data governance and access controls

### 🏪 Branches - Operational Excellence

Branches provide **geographic and functional distribution**:

- **Location Management**: Multiple campuses, offices, training centers
- **Resource Allocation**: Dedicated equipment and facility management
- **Local Administration**: Branch-specific managers and policies
- **Exam Logistics**: Location-specific scheduling and proctoring

## 📊 Database Schema (Exact Plan Implementation)

### Organizations Table ✅

```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- name: VARCHAR (Unique)
- description: TEXT (Nullable)
- isActive: BOOLEAN (Default: true)
- createdAt: TIMESTAMP (Manual, not @CreateDateColumn)
- logoUrl: VARCHAR (Nullable)
- website: VARCHAR (Nullable)
```

### Branches Table ✅

```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- name: VARCHAR
- address: TEXT (Nullable)
- contactNumber: VARCHAR (Nullable)
- email: VARCHAR (Nullable)
- isActive: BOOLEAN (Default: true)
- createdAt: TIMESTAMP (Manual, not @CreateDateColumn)
- managerName: VARCHAR (Nullable)
- operatingHours: JSON (Nullable)
- organizationId: UUID (Foreign Key, no CASCADE)
```

## 🚀 Enhanced Usage Examples

### Creating a University Organization

```typescript
POST /organizations
{
  "name": "Stanford University",
  "description": "Leading research university with world-class programs in technology, medicine, and business",
  "logoUrl": "https://cdn.stanford.edu/logo.png",
  "website": "https://www.stanford.edu"
}
```

### Creating a Medical Campus Branch

```typescript
POST /organizations/{organizationId}/branches
{
  "name": "Medical Center Campus",
  "address": "450 Medical Plaza Drive, Health Sciences District, CA 90095",
  "contactNumber": "+1-310-825-9111",
  "email": "medcenter@university.edu",
  "managerName": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
  "operatingHours": {
    "opening": "07:00",
    "closing": "19:00",
    "days": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]
  }
}
```
