Account Status Update

Hello {{firstName}},

We hope this message finds you well. We're reaching out to inform you about an important update to your {{companyName}} account status.

‚è∏Ô∏è ACCOUNT TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED

Your learning account has been temporarily deactivated. While this means you won't be able to access courses or take tests for now, this is a temporary status that can be changed when circumstances allow.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
‚Ä¢ Name: {{firstName}} {{lastName}}
‚Ä¢ Email: {{userEmail}}
{{#if organizationName}}‚Ä¢ Organization: {{organizationName}}{{/if}}
{{#if branchName}}‚Ä¢ Branch: {{branchName}}{{/if}}
{{#if reason}}‚Ä¢ Reason: {{reason}}{{/if}}

WHAT THIS MEANS:
Your account data, progress, and achievements remain safely stored. When your account is reactivated, you'll find everything exactly as you left it - your courses, progress, and all the hard work you've put into your learning journey.

LOOKING FORWARD:
We believe in the power of learning to transform lives and careers. This pause in your learning journey doesn't diminish the progress you've already made or the potential you have to achieve great things. When you're ready to return, we'll be here to welcome you back with open arms.

If you have questions about this change or believe this was done in error, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. We're committed to treating every situation with understanding and care.

Thank you for being part of our learning community. We genuinely hope to see you back soon and continue supporting your growth and success! üåü
